Architecture Overflow.
======================
    8086 has 12 generation register, such as : AX, BX, CX, DX, AH, AL, BH, BL, CH, CL, DH, DL.
And has 4 segement register, such as : DS, CS, ES, SS. 2 index register such as : SI, DI. 3 
pointer regsiter such as : IP, BP, SP. 8086 has a divide io mem for IO Deveice. The named io 
ports, 8086 have 1024 io ports for io device each one bytes. There are 2^16 = 65535 ports and 
each has one bytes. And one word such two bytes as for 16 bits ports. In the 8086 system, it's 
also user io map ways to oprate io ports which map the ioports address to memmory address, so
oprate the memmory like use the ioports.
	In the 8086 system, the effect address user the one WORD segement address and offect address
to address the memmory, the EA(effect address) = SEG << 4 + OFFECT.
